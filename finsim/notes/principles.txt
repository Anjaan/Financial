PREMISE: traditional models consistently over-estimate investment rewards

(1) in the very long term, the value of an equity is the present worth
	of the dividend stream it is expected to produce 
	
	in the short-to-medium term, they may retain and reinvest earnings
	reducing the dividend yield, but this increases their long term value
	and what doesn't show up as yield shows up as appreciation.
	 
	 	as of 6/30/09 dividend yields were in the 2-4% range
	
(2) that income stream is limited by the growth of the economy as a whole

	[to the extent that the economy is a zero sum game, but 
	 new markets are opened, and winners create new goods and 
	 services that take income away from losers]
	 
	 Over the past 200 years
	 	US GDP 	3.65% (1.8% per capita)
	 	UK GDP	1.97% (1.4% per capita)
	
(3) in the long run, dividend growth lags economic growth

	[because companies don't just pay out income as dividends]
	
	typical lag is on the order of 1% (half of dividends are retained)

(4) reinvestment today often means less lag tomorrow

	[because companies may make investments that improve growth]
	
(5) The Formula
	
		EquityReturn = DividendYield + DividendGrowth
						- Lag - Fees
						
				low  = 2.4% + 2% - 1% - .1% = 3.3%
				high = 3.5% + 3.5% - 1% - .1% = 5.9%
				
		TIPS are yielding a little over 2.3% (less .1% fees)
		
			free rate of return = 2.2%
			
		Equity Risk Premium is in the 1.1%-3.7% range
		
This does not justify the 9-12% average returns assumed by many tools.

STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION

	Most models assume the Markov property (ignoring regression
	to the mean).  The possibility of low-probability events, 
	allows long multi-year simulations to wind up with ludicrously 
	wide ranges of possible outcomes.  Averaging over this range
	is unreasonable, because high-side estimates over-power low-side
	estimates.
	
	The Markov property is a bad assumption.  Over the short term,
	yields are positively correlated, and over the medium term they
	are negatively correlated (reversion to the mean).
	
	Another problem is the assumption of a bell-curve ... because
	the out-lying events are not as unlikely as a standard bell-curve
	would suggest.
	
RETIREMENT BUDGETS

	He also says that retirement budgets are not reasonably modeled,
	but is less clear on how they should be fixed.
	
Comments from Allan Roth (CBS MoneyWatch) ... WHY MOST SIMS SUCK

	Unreasonably optimistic return assumptions.
	
	Unreasonable random rate generation.
	
Comments from William Sharpe

	Tixed life-span assumption is unreasonable, and
	this too should be factored in to the simulations
	
	The lessons of portfolio theory seem to be ignored by
	most simulations.  Harry Markowitz has defined an
	"Efficient Frontier" on the risk/return curve, which
	when compared with a client's risk tolerance (risk/return
	indifference curves) yields optimal portofolios.  No matter
	what your risk/return is, the optimal portfolio lies along
	the efficient frontier.
	
	The frontier is positively curved (you can do better than
	linear risk/reward) because of diversification.  If asset
	variations were perfectly correlated, you could do no better
	than linear risk/reward, but poorly correlated assets will
	actually reduce the sigma of your overall portfolio.
	
	Tools and advisors seem poorly able to assess a clients
	risk/reward tolerance (and thus the right indifference
	curve and the optimal portfolio) ... and so wind up suggesting
	inappropriate portfolios.
	
Comments from William Bernstein

	There is a risk in using averages, because of the short-term
	positive correlation of returns.   You might be statistically
	OK, but if you happen to start your retirement during a 4-8 year
	bear market, you are toast.
	
	[I would think that a more dynamic expense model, where discretionary
	 harvests varied with returns would help here]
