Prototyping Approach

(1) initially, don't worry about input format
    do modeling from hand crafted objects.
    
(2) order: expense, income, portfolio, taxes

(3) work on composable models
    (a) flat, two-step, three-step
    (b) load proportional (and load can be zero)
    (c) random factors
    
(4) compare results with the spreadsheet

(5) harvest modeling

(6) medical expense modeling

(7) then work on discrete events
