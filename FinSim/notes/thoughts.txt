Goals
	(1) more realistic simulations than my flat rate assumptions
		which can best be obtained by monte-carlo based on historical ranges

This problem can be broken down into several distinct pieces:
  (1) an engine that plays out a portfolio scenario
  (2) a set of rate-generation plug-ins to permit randomness
  (3) a monte-carlo driver to run sets of scenarii
  (4) ability to compare predictions w/actual results
  (5) results browser(s)
  (6) input editor(s)
  
Input files:
  (1) portfolio
  		name, year, class, value, basis, growth functions
  (2) budgets
  		name, year, class, amount, growth function
  (3) tax models
  		name, year, class, named parameters
  (4) discrete events
  		I don't yet understand these
  
The main engine:
  for duration or until failure
	expense model
	income model
	portfolio model
	tax model
	harvest/investment model
	determine success
	
Growth models:
	interface: delta_pctg = growth(year)
    linear_growth_model(rate, end year)
    piecewise_growth_model(rate1, year2, rate2, year3, rate3, endyear)
    load_model(loadfunc, rate)
    random_growth_model(mean, min, max);
    ? perhaps I want to compose models, imposing growth, on load, with a window
    
Life expectancy modeling also has to be factored in to this

Discrete Event models:
    predictable expense, income, investment events
